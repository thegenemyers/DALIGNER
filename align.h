/*** INTERACTIVE vs BATCH version

     The defined constant INTERACTIVE (set in DB.h) determines whether an interactive or
       batch version of the routines in this library are compiled.  In batch mode, routines
       print an error message and exit.  In interactive mode, the routines place the error
       message in EPLACE (also defined in DB.h) and return an error value, typically NULL
       if the routine returns a pointer, and an unusual integer value if the routine returns
       an integer.
     Below when an error return is described, one should understand that this value is returned
       only if the routine was compiled in INTERACTIVE mode.

/*** PATH ABSTRACTION:

     Coordinates are *between* characters where 0 is the tick just before the first char,
     1 is the tick between the first and second character, and so on.  Our data structure
     is called a Path refering to its conceptualization in an edit graph.

     A local alignment is specified by the point '(abpos,bbpos)' at which its path in
     the underlying edit graph starts, and the point '(aepos,bepos)' at which it ends.
     In otherwords A[abpos+1..aepos] is aligned to B[bbpos+1..bepos] (assuming X[1] is
     the *first* character of X).

     There are 'diffs' differences in an optimal local alignment between the beginning and
     end points of the alignment (if computed by Compute_Trace), or nearly so (if computed
     by Local_Alignment).  

     Optionally, a Path can have additional information about the exact nature of the
     aligned substrings if the field 'trace' is not NULL.  Trace points to either an
     array of integers (if computed by a Compute_Trace routine), or an array of unsigned
     short integers (if computed by Local_Alignment).

     If computed by Local_Alignment 'trace' points at a list of 'tlen' (always even) short
     values:

            d_0, b_0, d_1, b_1, ... d_n-1, b_n-1, d_n, b_n

     to be interpreted as follows.  The alignment from (abpos,bbpos) to (aepos,bepos)
     passes through the n trace points for i in [1,n]:

            (a_i,b_i) where a_i = floor(abpos/TS)*TS + i*TS
                        and b_i = bbpos + (b_0 + b_1 + b_i-1)

     where also let a_0,b_0 = abpos,bbpos and a_(n+1),b_(n+1) = aepos,bepos.  That is, the
     interior (i.e. i != 0 and i != n+1) trace points pass through every TS'th position of
     the aread where TS is the "trace spacing" employed when finding the alignment (see
     New_Align_Spec).  Typically TS is 100.  Then d_i is the number of differences in the
     portion of the alignment between (a_i,b_i) and (a_i+1,b_i+1).  These trace points allow
     the Compute_Trace routines to efficiently compute the exact alignment between the two
     reads by efficiently computing exact alignments between consecutive pairs of trace points.
     Moreover, the diff values give one an idea of the quality of the alignment along every
     segment of TS symbols of the aread.

     If computed by a Compute_Trace routine, 'trace' points at a list of 'tlen' integers
     < i1, i2, ... in > that encodes an exact alignment as follows.  A negative number j
     indicates that a dash should be placed before A[-j] and a positive number k indicates
     that a dash should be placed before B[k], where A and B are the two sequences of the
     overlap.  The indels occur in the trace in the order in which they occur along the
     alignment.  For a good example of how to "decode" a trace into an alignment, see the
     code for the routine Print_Alignment.

/*** ALIGNMENT ABSTRACTION:

     An alignment is modeled by an Alignment record, which in addition to a *pointer* to a
     'path', gives pointers to the A and B sequences, their lengths, and indicates whether
     the B-sequence needs to be complemented ('comp' non-zero if so).  The 'trace' pointer
     of the 'path' subrecord can be either NULL, a list of pass-through points, or an exact
     trace depending on what routines have been called on the record.

     One can (1) compute a trace, with Compute_Trace, either from scratch if 'path.trace' = NULL,
     or using the sequence of pass-through points in trace, (2) print an ASCII representation
     of an alignment, or (3) reverse the roles of A and B, and (4) complement a sequence
     (which is a reversible process).

     If the alignment record shows the B sequence as complemented, *** THEN IT IS THE
     RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CALLER *** to make sure that bseq points at a complement of
     the sequence before calling Compute_Trace or Print_Alignment.  Complement_Seq complements
     the sequence a of length n.  The operation does the complementation/reversal in place.
     Calling it a second time on a given fragment restores it to its original state.

     freed with Free_Align_Spec when no longer needed.  There are 4 essential parameters:

     ave_corr:    the average correlation (1 - 2*error_rate) for the sought alignments.  For Pacbio
                    data we set this to .70 assuming an average of 15% error in each read.
     trace_space: the spacing interval for keeping trace points and segment differences (see
                    description of 'trace' for Paths above)
     freq[4]:     a 4-element vector where afreq[0] = frequency of A, f(A), freq[1] = f(C),
                    freq[2] = f(G), and freq[3] = f(T).  This vector is part of the header
                    of every HITS database (see db.h).

     If an alignment cannot reach the boundary of the d.p. matrix with this condition (i.e.
     overlap), then the last/first 30 columns of the alignment are guaranteed to be
     suffix/prefix positive at correlation ave_corr * g(freq) where g is an empirically
     measured function that increases from 1 as the entropy of freq decreases.  If memory is
     unavailable or the freq distribution is too skewed then NULL is returned.

       (c) if lbord >= 0, then the alignment is always above diagonal low-lbord, and

     trace between successive pass through points.  It is much, much faster than Compute_Trace_ALL

     perfect.  Compute_Trace_MID computes a trace by computing the trace between the mid-points
     of alignments between two adjacent pairs of pass through points.  It is generally twice as

     displayed.

     If the alignment trace is an exact trace, then one can ask Print_Alignment to print an
     ASCII representation of the alignment 'align' to the file 'file'.  Indent the display
     by "indent" spaces and put "width" columns per line in the display.  Show "border"
     characters of sequence on each side of the aligned region.  If upper is non-zero then
     display bases in upper case.  If coord is greater than 0, then the positions of the

     coord's value.

     per segment, it prints "block" characters of the A sequence in each segment.  This results
     in segments of different lengths, but is convenient when looking at two alignments involving
     A as segments are guaranteed to cover the same interval of A in a segment.

     Both Print routines return 1 if an error occurred (not enough memory), and 0 otherwise.

     Flip_Alignment modifies align so the roles of A and B are reversed.  If full is off then
